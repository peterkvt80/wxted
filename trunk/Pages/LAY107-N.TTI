OL,6, Scientists in China have built the     
OL,7, first car that can run off a bowl of   
OL,8, rice.

OL,10,ÜThe scientists discovered that when an 
OL,11,Üelectro-magnetic pulse was fired       
OL,12,Üthrough a glass prism, an enormous     
OL,13,Ümagnetic field is created. Once the    
OL,14,Ümagnetic field is harnessed, it is     
OL,15,Üforced back through the rice, creating 
OL,16,Üenough power to drive a standard car   
OL,17,Üfor up to 5 furlongs.                  
OL,18,ÜA prototype, 'The Locust 15' was       
OL,19,Üunveiled on Saturday at a public
