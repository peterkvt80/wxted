#summary Development Environment for wxTED

= Introduction =

wxTED is written in C++ with the wxWidgets GUI library. It also uses the wxSmith helper to do the layout. I used Windows.

= Details =

This is what I use to develop wxTED.
  * Code::Blocks IDE bundled with the mingw compiler.
  * wxWidgets GUI

= Configuring =
wxWidgets takes a bit of configuring. First you need to change your PATH variable to allow the makefile to work. This was what I added to the Windows PATH.

C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin;

The options I chose to set are the default ones documented which are:

 * MONOLITHIC
 * UNICODE
 * SHARED

This makes the dll, which I copied to the bin\Release folder.

Code::Blocks Project Build Options needs wxWidgets in the Search directories. On my system this is C:\wxWidgets-3.0.2\include

For the FTP uploading function of the Publish option in Linker settings-->Other linker options you need to add -lwininet.

There is no install for the finished system. It must be distributed with the dll  that was made during the install of wxWidgets, which on my setup is called wxmsw30u_gcc_custom.dll.
=Font=
The font that I used is teletext2.ttf. I can't remember where it came from and I didn't see any author or copyright. I found it referenced by some css one day so I grabbed it as it looked useful. It has most European and Middle Eastern languages and the G3 smooth graphics shapes. The font appears to be suitable for teletext level 2.5 and 3.5.

I am targetting this application to use Unicode but where possible I will use methods to make it work when compiled for ASCII.,
