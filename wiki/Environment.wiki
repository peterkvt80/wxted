#summary Development Environment for wxTED

= Introduction =

wxTED is written in C++ with the wxWidgets GUI library. It also uses the wxSmith helper to do the layout. I used Windows.

= Details =

This is what I use to develop wxTED.
  * Code::Blocks IDE bundled with the mingw compiler.
  * wxWidgets GUI

= Configuring =
wxWidgets takes a bit of configuring. First you need to change your PATH variable to allow the makefile to work. This was what I added to the Windows PATH.

C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin;

The options I chose to set are the default ones documented which are:

 * MONOLITHIC
 * UNICODE
 * SHARED

This makes the dll, which I copied to the bin\Release folder.

Code::Blocks Project Build Options needs wxWidgets in the Search directories. On my system this is C:\wxWidgets-3.0.2\include

For the FTP uploading function of the Publish option in Linker settings-->Other linker options you need to add -lwininet.

There is no install for the finished system. It must be distributed with the dll  that was made during the install of wxWidgets, which on my setup is called wxmsw30u_gcc_custom.dll.
