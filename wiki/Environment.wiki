#summary Development Environment for wxTED

= Introduction =

wxTED is written in C++ with the wxWidgets GUI library. It also uses the wxSmith helper to do the layout. I used Windows.

= Details =

This is what I use to develop wxTED.
  * Code::Blocks IDE bundled with the mingw compiler.
  * wxWidgets GUI

= Configuring =
wxWidgets takes a bit of configuring. First you need to change your PATH variable to allow the makefile to work. This was what I added to the Windows PATH.

C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\bin;

The options I chose to set are the default ones documented which are:

 * MONOLITHIC
 * UNICODE
 * SHARED

This makes the dll, which I copied to the bin\Release folder.
