OL,8,
OL,9,‡Dear Doctor,ƒnext week I have to give a
OL,10,ƒbig speech in front of 200 colleagues  
OL,11,ƒin a large hall. I have always been       
OL,12,ƒabsolutely terrified of speaking in    
OL,13,ƒpublic, and I do not know how I am     
OL,14,ƒgoing to cope on the big day. I worry  
OL,15,ƒthat I might even faint. Do you have   
OL,16,ƒany advice at all? Please help me.     
OL,17,

OL,8, ƒThe key to public speaking is to be   
OL,9, ƒrelaxed. So, if you're still feeling  
OL,10, ƒnervous when you get up to give your  
OL,11, ƒspeech, a good way to relax is to     
OL,12, ƒimagine what your audience would look 
OL,13, ƒlike if they were skeletons. If that  
OL,14, ƒdoesn't work, imagine them as bundles 
OL,15, ƒof tissue, sinew and muscle tissue.   
OL,16, ƒFinally, and as a last resort, imagine
OL,17, ƒthem as buckets of blood.
